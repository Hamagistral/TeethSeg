## Endpoints

### /api/v1/predict

Without post-proccessing (this will not give a good result)

### /api/v1/predict/post_processing

Here's the available endpoints and the methods to call them:

- GET "/": Description of the API and its routes  
- POST "/api/v1/predict": Without post-proccessing (this will not give a good result)
- POST "/api/v1/predict/post_processing": With post-proccessing (The segmentation with post proccessing is more precise)

Go to http://localhost:8000/ if you see a message like "message": "Hi 3DSF Interns!" everything is working correctly.

Make sure to call "/api/v1/predict" and "/api/v1/predict/post_processing" endpoints with the POST method.
