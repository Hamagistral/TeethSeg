# ☁️ TeethSeg BackEnd in the Cloud

## I. Description

The backend of TeethSeg is a RESTful API developed using Python FastAPI, ensuring robust functionality and reliability. For deployment we used the AWS Cloud using the Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR), Lambda and API Gateway services. Here's the architecture of the backend in the AWS Cloud.
